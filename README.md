# AstroLLM
AstroLLM will be a multimodal AI assistant that:
- Fetches real data from NASA APIs (APOD, Mars Rover Photo...).
- Uses vision model to analyze NASA images or user-uploaded images.
- Uses fine-tuned small LLM to explain, answer questions, and reason about astronomy data.
- Runs locally on my RTX 3050 GPU with optimizations (LoRA, quantization).
- Offers a user-facing interface (web app).


data integration + LLM training + computer vision + deployment
